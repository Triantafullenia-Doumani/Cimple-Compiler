About Cimple

Cimple is a simple educational programming language based on C.

This language supports popular programming commands and functions like:
While / If - Else / Switchcase / Return / Print / Input / Call  .
Î‘lso includes the new commands :
Forcase and Incase .

Cimple also supports functions and procedures, pass by reference and by value ,recursive calls
and declaration of nested functions(Not supported by C).

However, Cimple does not support basic programming tools like:
For loops , Strings , Real numbers and Arrays.
These omissions have been made for educational purposes in order to simplify the procedure construction of the compiler.

Lastly, The compiler will produce, as the final language, the assembly language of the MIPS processor.Using a MIPS emulator we will be able to execute the assembly code generated by the compiler.

Cimple files end in .ci
