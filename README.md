# Cimple-Compiler
Compiler of Cimple (simple educational programming language based on C) written in python

About Cimple

Cimple is a simple educational programming language based on C.

This language supports popular programming commands and functions like:

While 			
If - Else 
Switchcase
Return 
Print 
Input 
Call 

Αlso includes the new commands :
Forcase and Incase .

Cimple also supports functions and procedures, pass by reference and by value ,recursive calls
and declaration of nested functions(Not supported by C).

However Cimple does not support basic programming tools like:

For loops 
Strings 
Real numbers
Arrays


These omissions have been made for educational purposes in order to simplify the procedure construction of the compiler.

Lastly, The compiler will produce, as the final language, the assembly language of the MIPS processor.Using a MIPS emulator we will be able to execute the assembly code generated by the compiler.

The Cimple alphabet


• Letters( Α,...,Ζ and a,...,z )

• Digits ( 0,...,9 )

• Arithmetic operations ( +, -, *, / )

• Relational operators ( <, >, =, <=, >=, <> )

• Assignment symbol( := )

• Separators ( ;, “,” , : )

• Grouping symbols( [, ], (, ) , { , } )

• Program termination symbol ( . )

• Comment separation( # )

The priority of the operators from the largest to the smallest is:


• *, /

• +, -

•  =, <, >, <>, <=, >=

• not

• and

• or

The symbols [,] are used in logical representations such as the symbols (,) in numbers
representations.

The numbers take values from –(2^32 − 1)t o (2^32 − 1).

Language identifiers (ID) are strings consisting of letters and letters , but starting with a letter.
ID with more than 30 characters are considered incorrect.

The white characters (tab, space, return) are ignored.

#STATEMENTS
      

    • Assignment 

	ID := expression
	
	Used to assign the value of a variable or a constant, or an expression
	in a variable.
      

    • If - Else

	if ( condition )
	
		statements 1
		
	[else
	
		statements 2 ]

    • while

	while ( condition )
	
		statements



    • switchcase
      
      The switchcase repetition structure checks the conditions after the cases. 
      
      Just one of these are found to be true, then the statements1 are executed (following the contion). 
      
      The programm then continues out of switchcase.
      
      If none of the cases apply, then the control goes to default and statements2 are executed.
      Then the programm continues .
      
	switchcase
	
		(case ( condition ) statements 1 ) ∗
		
		default statements 2

    • forcase
      
      The forcase repetition structure checks the conditions after the cases. 
      
      Just one of these are found to be true, then the statements1 are executed (following the contion). 
      
      The programm then goes to the beginning of forcase.
      
      If none of the cases apply, then the control goes to default and statements2 are executed.
      Then the programm continues .
      
	forcase
	
		(case ( condition ) statements 1 ) ∗
		
		default statements 2

    • Incase
      
      The incase repetition structure checks the conditions after the cases, examining themin order. 
      
      For each for which the corresponding condition applies, the statements are executed(following the condition). 
      
      All conditions will be examined in turn and will be executed all statements whose conditions apply. 
      
      After all the cases are examined, the control goes outside the incase structure if none of the statements have been executed, or goes to the beginning of the incase, if even one of the statements has been executed.
      
	incase
	
		(case ( condition ) statements 1 ) ∗
		
		default statements 2


    • return

	return ( expression )

    • print

	print ( expression )

    • input

	input ( ID )

	Asks the user to enter a value through the keyboard. The input value will be 	given to the variable ID.

    • call

	call funtionName ( actualParameters)

Scope rules

Global are the variables declared in the main program and are accessible to all.

Local are the variables declared in a function or process and are only accessible through that function or process.
